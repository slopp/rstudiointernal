# rstudiointernal

This package is a demo showing how you might create an internal package for your organization. Build it again!

Internal packages can provide data science teams with:

- A ggplot2 theme to give the data science team's work 
  consistent and branded appearance
- A R Markdown template that includes corporate
  styling and logos
- Functions for connecting to corporate data stores
